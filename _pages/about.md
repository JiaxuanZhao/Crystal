My name is Jiaxuan(Crystal) Zhao. You can call me Crystal if you want. 

I am a Biostatistic student and probably gonna work in a biostat lab in the future. In the free time, I like to paint water color, anime and maybe go to the gym. Of course, eating and sleeping are my top hobbits 😂😂😂. 

I also like to watch anime. One piece, Katekyō Hitman Reborn!, Meitantei Konan, etc.

In this web, I am gonna post my past drawings and paintings, and my daily life (I guess most gonna be complains). 

If you have any concerns, feel free to contact me 😊.
